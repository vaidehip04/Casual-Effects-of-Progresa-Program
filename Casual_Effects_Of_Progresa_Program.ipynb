From the table, we can see that there is existing difference for some variables in the treatment and control groups and hence it would be difficult to measure the true impact of the treatment. In this case, other strategies such as stratified sample, double differences etc. can be used to to measure the impact of treatment without bias."

By comparing the average enrollment rate for poor population in the treatment and control villages in year 1997 and 1998, we see that there is a positive effect in the schooling rate for treatment villages group after the program was implemented and this effect is statistically significant since p-value < 0.05 in all the cases.\n"

    "We have three kinds of estimators. \n",

    "In the first estimator, we consider effect on the schooling rate, before and after the program was implemented. This is not quite accurate as the the difference before and after has been measured solely on the basis of one parameter. There could be other factors in the progresa villages which could attribute to the increase in schooling rate eg. increase in income, standard of living etc. which remain unknown due to this method.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the second estimator we only considers the treatment and control goup effect on schooling rate in the progresa villages. Here too, we ignore unobserved characteristics and assumptions as we do not take into consideration the before and after effect of the implementation of the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "According to me, difference in difference estimator is a better method as it eliminates any unobserved characteristics and it gets subtracted in the difference. The diff-in-diff estimator considers the effect on the schooling rate on the treatment and control villages before and after the program and seems to relax the assumption of conditional exogeneity or selection on observed characteristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, according to my analysis, the Progresa program had a causal impact on the enrollment rates of the poor households in Mexico and the increase in schooling enrollment was statistically significant. However, to make a more accurate judgement, we need more economic details to ascertain the efficacy of this program."
